            <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
            <p>COVID-19 has a significant impact on the physical and mental health of elderly people. Social distancing
                measures and lockdowns have made it challenging for them to stay active and engaged, which increased
                social isolation and a higher risk of depression and anxiety. Moreover, some old people have a higher
                risk of severe illness from COVID-19, which can worsen pre-existing health issues and limit their
                ability to participate in physical activities and social interactions. Therefore, this
                app aims to provide a solution to these challenges by offering the following features:
            <ul>
                <li>Exercises that can be done at home to support the elderlyâ€™s physical abilities.</li>
                <li>Access to mental health resources and support networks.</li>
                <li>Reminders, such as taking medications and keeping up with doctor's appointments.</li>
                <li>Resources about COVID-19. For example, the latest news, prevention tips, and what to do when having
                    the symptoms.</li>
                <li>Stress-free News accessibility.</li>
                <li>Connection: Chat with other elderly that may have common interests.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <div id="research">
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Although there are apps and websites available to support elderly mental health, they may not provide
                    all the features that are specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of elderly individuals.
                    While these existing apps and websites offer health resources, the ability to contact doctors, and
                    reminders, they may not cover all the aspects that the elderly require. </p>

                        <h5>Methodology of the survey :</h5>
                        <p>
                            To ensure that our app meets the needs of the elderly users in the Greater Montreal area,
                            we conducted a thoughtful survey at several nursing homes. In this survey,
                            we respectfully approached residents aged 60 and over to ask about their mental well-being
                            and what type of features they would appreciate in a mental health app.
                            In recognition of the fact that some elderly users may not be as familiar with technology,
                            we asked questions that were carefully designed to grasp their wants and needs.
                            We are optimistic that the results of our survey will guide us in developing an app that
                            truly
                            addresses the unique requirements of our target audience.

                                After conducting a thorough survey, we discovered that the majority of elderly individuals use mobile phones on a daily basis. In response, we created a mobile application that is easily accessible and user-friendly. We tailored the app's features based on the survey results, such as the 90% of participants who expressed the need for a reminder feature, and 66.7% who requested the ability to engage in physical exercises and chat with friends. Additionally, the survey revealed that participants preferred simple and intuitive menus and navigation buttons, and desired quick access to the app's features. These valuable insights from the survey helped us plan and develop the app's design, ensuring that it meets the needs and preferences of our target audience.

                        the unique needs of our elderly users. Pastel colors are known for their softness and soothing
                        effect on the eyes, making them a perfect fit for our user demographic. We wanted to create a
                        welcoming and comfortable online environment, and using these gentle hues helps to achieve that
                        goal. Additionally, pastel colors have a timeless quality that can lend a sense of stability and
                        reliability to our website, further enhancing the user experience.</p>

                        <p>Based on the insights gathered from our survey and research, we believe that the development
                            of a mobile application to support the mental and physical health of elderly people is a
                            critical initiative. The app should incorporate features that are tailored to meet the
                            unique needs of this demographic, such as mental health assistance, reminders, positive news
                            and social connectivity . The chooses we made for the app design can create a comfortable
                            and welcoming experience for the elderly. By addressing the challenges faced by seniors
                            during the pandemic and beyond, this app has the potential to improve the quality of life of
                            millions of elderly individuals worldwide. We look forward to the implementation of this
                            initiative and the positive impact it can have on the elderly community.</p>
